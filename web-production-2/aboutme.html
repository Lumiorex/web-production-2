    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <p> As of the time I'm writing this, I'm a junior at Hunter that's majoring in Emerging Media. Originally, I was double-majoring alongside Computer Science, but decided that the major wasn't for me. However, I'm looking to apply for the CUNY BA program this upcoming Spring, with the self-proclaimed major of Social Media Management.

    <p> I spend the majority of my time on the Internet, either reading, browsing social media, or playing videogames. I'm currently very into League of Legends, Valorant, and the critically acclaimed MMORPG, Final Fantasy XIV.

    <p> I occasionally draw digitally, but nothing too crazy (you can find some of my works under the "Personal Works" tab).
